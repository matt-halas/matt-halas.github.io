      <h2>Section 6</h2>
      <h3>Day 42</h3>
      <p>
        The group was alright with giving me a later start today as I struggled out of bed and packed while limping around. We started at
        around 10:30. Today had one of the highest climbs of the entire route. Going up 1000m to 3250m of elevation. The start ran along
        highway, eventually breaking back into gravel roads. Everyone from the group split up here, and we all climbed at our own pace.
        Brandon and I leap-frogged a few times. After four hours of climbing and losing the shoes off the back of my bike, we took a nice
        rest at the top of the pass.

        Everyone else zoomed ahead as I took my time on the downhill again. I passed by the gate for the plus/minus ranch. We regrouped at a
        gas station in Sargents, and tried to find a spot to camp for the night. There weren't any clearly marked spots up ahead, so we
        decided to continue on and stop at whatever spot looked good. We rode along highway for 20 km, then turned back into gravel roads
        through ranchlands. We found a spot near a creek that didn't explicitly prohibit camping, so we set up there. Joe brought a
        collapsable camping chair, and offered it to me to use during dinner!
