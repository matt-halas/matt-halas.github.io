      <h1>About me!</h1>
      <p>
        I graduated from the University of Calgary in December 2021 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and a specialization in Energy
        and Environmental Engineering. In my second year, I started this specialization knowing that I would like to focus my career on the
        low carbon energy industry. Through this specialization, I enrolled in several courses related to energy including gas dynamics,
        aerodynamics, and turbomachinery.

        During my time at the U of C, I was a member of the Zeus Electric Motorsport team. In this club, we designed, built, and raced a
        fully electric motorcycle. Through this team, I gained experience in design, prototyping, and testing.

        When I'm not working, you can find me biking, running, or playing guitar. In 2021, I took my bicycle from Calgary to Vancouver (you
        can read about the trip
        <a href='{% url "projectView" "bike-trip-week-1" %}'>here!</a>
        ). After this trip, I fell in love with bike touring and in 2024, biked from Banff to the Mexico border on the GDMBR.
