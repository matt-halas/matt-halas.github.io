      <h2>Section 2</h2>
      <p>
        Taking the time to write about this trip 2 months after finishing while winter is starting to pick up feels like reliving little
        bits of the trip. It is such a great escape.
      </p>
      <p>
        Section 2 of the trail winds through North Montana, taking the scenic route linking Whitefish, Seeley Lake, Lincoln, and Helena. As
        I mentioned before, I didn't do a lot of research going into this trip, but some notable spots that would have been good to know of
        are the free lodging available in Ovando and Llama ranch just outside of Helena. Ovando opened up some of their unused buildings to
        bikers and hikers passing through, and you can either sleep in the old jailhouse or the basement of the community center. Llama
        ranch is a gem of a spot, where Barbara and Jon are happy to host bikers and hikers in their cabins all around the property.
      </p>
      <h3>Day 9</h3>
      <p>
        After one too many beers the night before, I crawled out of my tent while most of the group were packing up theirs. I let them know
        the night before that I might have a later start and was alright with catching up throughout the day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Leaving Eureka, the road ran beside the main highway, running alongside ranches and ponderosa forests. After turning off towards the
        hills and out of the valley, I got hit by a wonderful tail wind, making the next 10km of a slight uphill feel flat. I was trying to
        catch up with the group so I pushed as hard as I could till the top of the pass. Unfortunately, the group was already gone so I took
        some time to rest after the effort.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/GDMBR/section2/day9-pass.jpg" alt="bigmoth" width="85%" />
      <p>
        I continued on and kept pushing to try to catch up to the group. At the other side of the pass, the valley opened up to a view of
        Glacier National Park. With no sign of the group, I continued up the next pass, the last one before Whitefish. The whole time I was
        keeping an eye on a set of tire tracks in the dirt thinking that they were from the group. After struggling up the rest of the pass,
        I made it to Red Meadow Lake at the top. I found out that the tracks I was following were not from the group, but instead from a
        couple from New Zealand! Brian and Kelly. They were such a joy to be around, and had plenty of stories from previous bikepacking
        trips to share. After chatting for a bit and a quick swim, I got started on dinner. The temperature plummeted in the evening, rain
        started to fall, and wind started to pick up. There was hardly any shelter since I had my tent set up on the lakeside, so I tried to
        huddle behind the tent to stay sheltered from the sideways rain while I cooked. I had a vision for a meal of refried beans,
        couscous, and tuna, but that ended up as a slop after I mixed everything in the one cooking container I had, a kettle. But you'll
        eat anything after biking for 7 hours, and I couldn't afford to not eat it. So I sat down with Brian and Kelly and joined them for
        dinner.
      </p>

      <p>
        After dinner, I was rushing to clean up my dishes and get ready for bed so I could warm up in my sleeping bag. Then suddenly, the
        rain stopped, the clouds broke, and the air got still. We were treated to one of the most beautiful evenings of the trip. Everyone
        in the campground stopped what they were doing and turned to watch the lake, the rainbow, and the sun light up the neighboring
        mountain. Both Brian and I set up our cameras to get a timelapse of the sun setting.

      <h3>Day 10</h3>
      <p>
        This was the first night that the sleeping bag had to be zipped up all the way. It was a shock after yesterday mornings low
        temperature of ~15&deg;C, where I used the sleeping bag more as a blanket. The temperature may have dropped below zero, Brian said
        there was some frost. I made some tea and contemplated starting to pack, but I decided to wait since the start of the day would be
        nothing but downhill and I would freeze. I went back to sleep while waiting for the temperature to climb a little.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/GDMBR/section2/day10-tea.png" alt="tea time" width="85%" />
      <p>
        After waking up again at 9, the sun was fully up. I decided again to delay my start and wait for the group. I waited by the lake and
        at around 11, I could hear whirring in the distance. It was Clo's drone following them up the hill! They were relieved to find me
        after I missed their camp yesterday. They got a great sunset too, so we exchanged some pictures of the views from last evening. They
        waited around while I packed up and got ready for the road to Whitefish. The road on the way down was quite rough, but still much
        much faster than the way up. On the way down, we ran into a dog that was making trips up and down one stretch of the road. It kept
        approaching us walking away, seeming to be spooked by the bikes. After five minutes of trying to get the dog to follow us, we gave
        up and kept going. About 15 minutes later, we heard someone calling for what we assumed to be a dog so we called out and the guy
        turned out to be the owner! We let him know where we last saw it and wished him luck.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of the road into Whitefish was pretty uneventful but I remember feeling so happy to be biking with this group. Jon's
        friend, Pox, had a place in town and he was excited to host us for beers and lunch. The invitation stretched into an offer to camp
        in his backyard or set up bedrolls on the floor in his house. So with a place to stay, we had the rest of the afternoon and evening
        to relax, restock, and explore Whitefish. Pox even made a call to one of his friends at the bike shop in town to get me in for a
        much needed brake bleed.

      <h3>Day 11</h3>
      <p>
        The group decided to take the day off, but I wanted to keep putting in some more distance since I had a rest day just two days ago.
        Pox cooked us breakfast, then we went to the bike shop together before parting ways. Unfortunately, this would be the last time I'd
        meet up with this group, just barely missing them at the south end of Montana. The day started out normally enough, with paved roads
        leading out of Whitefish. I passed a few flocks of road bikers who saw my bags and wished me luck on the trail. The trail wasn't
        particularly difficult, but after staying up late the night before, the kilometers started going by a lot more slowly. I started
        looking for places to set up my hammock for a siesta, but the area I was in was all private land. I found a forest service road with
        some public land a kilometer away from the main road so I set my sights on that. At the entrance to the FSR, I ran into Brian and
        Kelly again! They stayed at a house hosted on WarmShowers nearby, and were about 20 minutes into their day (it was 3 pm). After
        catching up on the past day, we parted ways again as I went up the FSR to take a nap.
      </p>
      <p>
        The nap didn't help as much as I hoped it would, but I continued on. The evening was approaching and I had no clue where I was going
        to camp. The resupplies in the next stretch were looking a little thin, so I played it safe and decided to make a detour into the
        town of Big Fork. The sun was almost completely down by the time I finished buying food, and I still didn't know where I was going
        to sleep. I'm normally indecisive, and the fatigue from the day definitely made that worse. I got stuck trying to decide between the
        campsite next to town that may or may not be full, or a motel in town. After overthinking for a good 15 minutes, I tried out the
        campsite. With 5 more kilometers of biking and a massive downhill into the campsite, I was really hoping they wouldn't turn me away
        to climb back out. I pulled into the site, and was greeted by a couple groups of bikers finishing up their dinner. They pointed me
        to one of the last vacant sites. Phew! I lucked out with the site, the evening would have been miserable if I couldn't set up here.
        After a quick bite of food, I was eager to continue where I left off from the nap.

      <h4>Day 12</h4>
      <p>
        I packed up quite early, and went into town to get some coffee and breakfast. There was a cafe that had live music and amazing
        pastries. After enjoying a coffee and cinnamon roll, I continued on out of town. This was probably one of the least eventful days of
        the whole trip. Although there was a fairly long climb, the trail was treed in the whole time, blocking any views of the valley.
        Still not feeling 100% after the day before, I decided to call it after only ~60km of biking, since the campsite looked cozy.

      <h3>Day 13</h3>
      <p>
        After yesterdays short day, I felt obligated to make up for it today. I got going pretty early in the morning, and quickly made it
        through the first pass of the day. I was hoping to find a restaurant to eat at once I reached Holland Lake, but after going all the
        way around the lake, I discovered they were closed! It was a little dissapointing but I had more than enough food stocked up from
        the day before. The lake was gorgeous and was one of the few places where the forest is not blocking the views of the valley. I hung
        up my clothes to finish drying and had some lunch by the lake, and got going again in the late afternoon.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/GDMBR/section2/day13-dragonfly.jpg" alt="friend!" width="45%" />
      <p>
        The climb out of Holland lake wasn't very eventful, but it was loooong. The forest road near the top eventually ended, and the trail
        continued through singletrack. One section was washed out, leaving a scary looking slope right next to the trail.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/GDMBR/section2/day13-view.jpg" alt="view" width="85%" />
      <img src="/images/GDMBR/section2/day13-otherview.jpg" alt="another view" width="85%" />
      <p>
        The singletrack descent was really testing how well my bags were attached. The drainage channels were pretty much speed bumps, they
        might have been fun to launch off of without a loaded bike. Instead, they kept nudging the gear I had mounted on my handlebars
        towards the front wheel. Reaching the road was a relief as the sun was starting to go down at this point and my imagination was
        placing a bear around every blind corner. The road sent me down towards Seeley Lake at ~40km/h, it didn't take long at all to get
        there. In town, I got some dinner and chatted a bit with one of the regulars. The dinner did not seem to be enough so I stopped by
        the hot dog stand in town after as well. After my second dinner it was fully dark out, but I still had to get to camp (and reserve a
        site). After a couple of sketchy kilometers on the shoulder of the road, I made it to the campground, navigated the online site
        reservation system, and went about searching for my site.

      <h3>Day 14</h3>
      <p>
        The late night yesterday put me in no rush to get going in the morning. I went back into town to get some breakfast and restock on
        some food and fuel. I killed some time in one of the gift shops to wait out the rain that was just beginning, then I hit the road.
        My original goal for today was the town of Lincoln. The entire morning and early afternoon had a light rain, but I felt that it was
        perfect for the road that I was on today.

        The trail passed by several ponds, which paired with the fog and rain beautifully. Another biker and I passed each other a few times
        as we took breaks going up the hill. The rain let up and the clouds broke near the top of the pass, which turned out to be perfect
        timing. As I started heading downhill, my wheels were kicking up a bit of mud, but the sun quickly dried the rest of the road. I
        made it to Ovando, halfway to Lincoln, and sat down in the park for a snack. There were a few loaded up bikes by the general store.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/GDMBR/section2/day14-fog.jpg" alt="foggy" width="75%" />
      <p>
        A forest ranger pulled up to the bench I was resting at, and told me that the trail ahead was closed due to forest fires. Today was
        my cutoff day for deciding whether or not I would try to finish the trip before September, and after getting this news, I decided I
        was not going to make it, at least not while enjoying myself. There was so much unpredictability in this trip, and I felt like
        pushing myself to meet a deadline would just end up being stressful. So with that decision made, I also decided to stay in Ovando
        for the night.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/GDMBR/section2/day14-ovando.jpg" alt="another view" width="45%" />
      <p>
        While relaxing outside the general store, the biker that I saw leaving Seeley Lake rolled through town. She didn't see any of the
        signs about the trail closure, so I chased her down to let her know. While heading back to my spot by the general store, Brian and
        Kelly walked out! We caught up about the last few days. With them in town, along with a few other bikers, I was really happy I
        decided to stay in Ovando for the night. The biker that I met earlier in the day also decided to stay at the inn, and since I let
        her know about the trail closure, she offered me a cot in her room!
      </p>
      <p>
        The Inn had a full kitchen so I didn't want to pass up the opportunity to cook. The general store had enough for a basic meal of
        chicken, potatoes, and veggies. I had that on the go when the other bikers at the inn invited me for dinner. I couldn't pass that up
        so I joined them for a drink and a little bit of food. There, I met Yoann, another biker from France. His trip started from
        Victoria, so he rode the B.C. trail in the opposite direction as me. We had some good laughs about how rough parts of that trail
        were, and we swapped stories about some of the nicer sections. After returning to the inn, I had my dinner that was waiting in the
        oven, and chatted with Brian for a bit. I was hoping for more of a social evening since there were 7 other bikers staying at the
        inn, but by 8:30, everyone was in their rooms and asleep.

      <h3>Day 15</h3>
      <p>
        With the trail ahead closed, we decided on an alternate route over breakfast. Any other offroad trail would have added on too much
        distance, so we decided to take the highway to Lincoln, where we can continue on the actual trail. The Llama ranch, just past
        Lincoln was the goal for today. I wanted to take a small detour to ride around a lake close to Ovando, so I told them I'd meet up
        with them in town. After looping around the lake and hitting the highway, I started to dread the next 40km. The highway had a bit of
        a shoulder, but there was moderate traffic. The highway ran through a narrow valley, so there were a lot of bends and guardrails.
        Every time there was a large bend up ahead, I checked if there were any trucks behind me, then got through it as fast as I could. I
        think that this section was the fastest 40km on the entire trip. On the last stretch before town, I passed Brian and Kelly on a path
        on the other side of the road. In town, I saw Yoann's bike outside of a convenience store so I went in and we had some snacks
        together. He got going after a quick rest, but I wanted more time in town, so I went to the grocery store to restock and relax. I
        saw Brian and Kelly outside of the store, and they invited me for a late lunch. Us, and two other bikers went out to a restaurant,
        and we all were craving salads. The five comically large salad bowls could hardly fit on our table.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/GDMBR/section2/day15-friends.jpg" alt="friends!" width="60%" />
      <p>
        After lunch and goodbyes, I continued on towards Llama ranch. I once again put myself in a race against daylight, and put in all the
        effort I could gather to climb the pass outside of Lincoln. I do generally prefer to bike later in the day as it's cooling down, but
        it did put me in situations like this often. I tried my hardest to do the entire climb without taking my feet off the pedals, but
        steep grades and chunky rocks made me get off the bike with 200m of elevation to go. I tried to hurry along on the way down but 2
        minutes in, my saddle bag broke after my back wheel went over a large rut. The bag got jammed into the wheel, stopping it, and I
        narrowly avoided flying off the bike. After coming to a stop, I started trying to figure out ways to repair the bag, at least until
        I got to Llama ranch. I jerryrigged something up with my rope, and continued on. The sun was set by this point, so I didn't have
        much more dusk left. The first cow I saw gave me a good scare, but being around cows was weirdly reassuring. A little less worried
        about bears and cougars, I carried on until I saw a roof with a huge bike printed on it. Llama ranch!!! I rolled by, and saw Yoann
        sitting on the porch, working on his video. He showed me to the camping area, and Jon, one of the hosts at the ranch, came out to
        greet me and offer me drinks and a sandwich. I relaxed on the porch and had a couple of drinks with Yoann before setting up camp.
        While I was setting up, Yoann was setting up his camera for a long exposure shot of the clear night sky. The result was stunning.
        Unfortunately the picture he took that night isn't on his instagram.

      <h4>Day 16</h4>

      <p>
        I took it very slow in the morning (yet again), and enjoyed some breakfast and tea with the other bikers at the ranch. Yoann had the
        right idea, and got going in the morning before it got too warm. Today ended up being one of the hottest days during the trip,
        hitting 36&deg;C. Once I finally got around to packing up, Brian and Kelly rolled into the ranch, so I had lunch with them. During
        lunch, I was thinking of solutions for my broken saddle bag, and found a pannier rack that was compatible with full suspension
        mountain bikes. At this point in the trip, I was already considering some extra cargo space since I wanted the option of carrying
        more water. Although it was expensive, my options for full suspension pannier racks were pretty thin, so I ordered it to get to
        Helena, which was 50km away along the route. With that figured out, I finally packed up camp and hit the road at 2:00 pm. With the
        heat, I had to be mindful of keeping my effort low. Near the top of the major climb of the day, there was a pond, so I stopped for a
        swim. At the pond, there was a dad biking north on the trail with his son, who couldn't have been older than 12. I was amazed that a
        kid that young made it this far on the trail, but I had no doubts they'd make it to the end after making it this far.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/GDMBR/section2/day16-llama3.jpg" alt="another view" width="75%" />
      <p>
        At the end of the climb, I passed a man driving around on an ATV with his dog. He offered me some water, and I didn't realize I was
        low on water, so I declined. I'd kick myself over this for the next two hours, since 10 minutes later, I sucked the last of my water
        out of my reservoir. I wasn't far from Helena at this point, but the evening heat paired with a small hill between me and the city
        stressed me out about that a little. I had my eye out for any potential water sources, but being in a relatively dry ranchland in
        the late summer, I didn't want to chance the still water unless I really needed it. I promised myself that from now on, I would at
        least check my water before declining another offer. Other than the water situation, this evening was perfect. The ranchlands I was
        riding through were beautiful in the evening sun, and even as the sun went down, the temperatures were pleasant. The last stretch
        into Helena went along the interstate with a slight downward grade. The 10km went by fast, and I was set on getting into town for
        some water. By the time I reached camp, it was fully dark out. I ordered myself a pizza and started setting up my tent. The campsite
        catered to hikers and bikers, and had a communal kitchen area, showers, and drinking water. It was the perfect spot to spend a few
        nights waiting for my pannier rack to ship.
