      <h1>Biking the GDMBR!</h1>

      <p>
        The idea for this trip was planted in my mind around 4 years ago in 2020 after watching Ryan Van Duzer's video of the trail. I put
        the trip on my bucket list but didn't expect to be able to do it so soon! I wanted at least two months to complete the trip so that
        I wouldn't feel rushed, so being between jobs made the timing perfect.
      </p>

      <h2>The Route</h2>

      <p>
        The GDMBR (Great Divide Mountain Bike Route) is a mostly offroad route stretching from Banff, AB to Antelope Wells, NM, at the U.S.
        - Mexico border.
        <a href="https://bikepacking.com/routes/great-divide-mountain-bike-route-gdmbr/">This page on bikepacking.com</a>
        has all the details about the route, so feel free to read that if you are not familiar. But in short, the GDMBR is 4,500 km long,
        with 45,000 meters of elevation gain, and travels straight through the rocky mountains, crossing the continental divide countless
        times over the course of five states and two provinces. It is well known for an annual race where riders compete against each other
        and the world record for who can get through the route the fastest. I wanted nothing to do with that so while top riders can
        complete the route in 13-15 days, I gave myself 60.
      </p>

      </p>

      <h2>Preparation</h2>

      <p>
        I did not train as much as I should have in the weeks coming up to this trip. I got a few longer rides in but I was mostly
        preoccupied with getting things sorted for me being away for two months. So with a week to go until the trip, I decided that my
        first couple weeks would be the training. The setup was very similar to my first bike trip. I used the same bike (Trek fuel) and all
        the same bags. I did end up making a lot of modifications to my setup along the route though. I downloaded the route on ridewithGPS
        and used that primarily for guidance.

      <h2>Starting the Trip - Day 1</h2>

      <p>
        I got a later start than I was originally planning on beacause of some last minute packing. I left Banff at around 8:30 pm after my
        mom dropped me off, and the trip was underway! I biked through the familiar goat creek trail before the sun set, then put some
        lights on the bike for the remaining 10 km.

      </div>
      <p>
        As the daylight quickly faded I tried to pick up the pace to make it to the campsite before it was completely dark. Unfortunately I
        didn't make it in time, and it also started to rain with 5 km to go. I grit my teeth and made it before getting completely soaked.
        It wasn't a lot of biking, but after running around all day prepping for the trip, I was very ready for some sleep.

      <h3>Day 2</h3>
      <p>
        After some a quick chat with the campground host and a couple of granola bars, I was ready for the day. The singletrack going
        through the spray valley was slow going with all the hills but it was super fun nonetheless. I was starting to feel the lack of
        training partway through the day so I really slowed down after noon, taking breaks every hour or so. Even though the climbs were a
        struggle, the descents in this section were so much fun. My ambitions for how far I could go in one day were much greater than what
        my legs were capable of, so after sitting down for an ice cream at the Kananaskis Lakes, I decided to call it a day. The campground
        had showers, bear lockers, and a general store, I couldn't have asked for more!

      <script src="https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js"></script>
      <h3>Day 3</h3>
      <p>
        After taking my time to pack up in the morning, I had one more ice cream at the campground store then started the climb up the Elk
        Valley. I remember this being one of the more isolated sections from the last trip so I was relieved to see other people on the
        trail. The climb went through lush meadows with plenty of flowers. At the top, the trees opened up and the entire valley was
        visible. On the way down, I passed a couple of bikepackers making their way up the valley from the other side. After the descent, I
        set my sights on a campground just outside of Elkford. I made good time during the ascent so I could take my time getting to the
        campsite. I had a few chances to sit down at rest areas along the valley and read. I saw some more bikepackers setting up camp
        beside the river a few kilometers away from where I wanted to camp. It was so good to see so many others on the route! At this point
        I was hoping to find a group to ride with. The campground was quiet, and there were a couple of other groups set up there. I had
        time for a swim, then chatted with friends and family after being out of cell service for the last two days.

      <h3>Day 4</h3>
      <p>
        When I checked on my bear hang after waking up, I was greeted by this squirrel. It looked like it was in the process of planning how
        to take the food down from the tree. Luckily it didn't figure that out before I woke up.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/GDMBR/section1/plotting.jpg" alt="Sneaky squirrel" width="50%" />
      <p>
        The road into Elkford was short and I grabbed a coffeee and some cookies on my way through the town. While drinking my coffee, I was
        looking at jobs in the area. It took less than 24 hours in the Elk Valley to make me want to move there. Leaving Elkford, I passed
        another couple bikepackers, one going the opposite way, a few days away from the end of his trip, and one going the same way as me.
        I'm surprised I never ran into that biker again, but there would be no shortage of other people to bike with down the road. On the
        way to Sparwood, I spotted the biggest moth I've ever seen in my life.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/GDMBR/section1/bigmoth.jpg" alt="bigmoth" width="50%" />
      <p>
        The route I took today deviates from the official Tour Divide route. The official route doesn't go into Elkford, and instead leads
        up a gruelling hill into the next valley in the West. I wasn't dead set on following the exact trail and opted to go this way
        instead to go through towns and enjoy some of the singletrack between Sparwood and Fernie. The heat really hit me at Sparwood,
        especially on the roads where there was no shade. With a bout of deja vu from the last time I was bikepacking in this area, I took
        an extra long lunch to wait out the worst of the heat before starting on the trail to Fernie. Once I finally got going, I met up
        with a biker on the trail who had the exact same bike as me, but electric. We biked together for a bit and he told me stories of all
        the mountain biking he did 25 years back. He was into mountain biking before it was cool. After some time of trying to catch up to
        his e-bike, I needed a break, so I stopped and we parted ways. Meething people like this is one of my favorite aspects of
        bikepacking. Even when travelling alone, it is so easy to meet other people since many people are curious when they see the loaded
        up bike.
      </p>
      <p>
        My sister connected me with her friend who lives in Fernie, and she offered a room for the night (Thanks Kate!). After being slowed
        down by the hills around Fernie, I spent the evening trying to make up time so I wouldn't get there too late. I got to the house
        right as the sun was going down, and although they were already done with dinner, there was a plate waiting for me on the table!
        After a beer, dinner, and some chatting, I was ready to sleep on a real bed after the last few nights of camping.

      <script src="https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js"></script>
      <h3>Day 5 (rest)</h3>
      <p>
        I woke up super sore the next morning after the last evening of biking, and decided that I would take a rest day in Fernie. It was a
        Sunday so the streets and cafes were packed. I spent the morning reading, drinkng coffee, and doing some maintenance on the bike.
        After setting up in the campsite next to Fernie, I went down to the river to cool off. Apparently everyone in Fernie had the same
        idea, the river was full of boats, paddleboards, and people floating by.
      </p>
      <p>
        After I got back to camp, I met two guys from Calgary who were in Fernie to mountain bike. The campground was full so they offered
        to pay for my site if they could set up their tents there. Company and a free site! We had some dinner and drinks together, and made
        plans to bike together at Bragg Creek once my trip was done.
      </p>
      <h3>Day 6</h3>
      <p>
        The next morning, I made the obligatory stop at Big Bang Bagels for breakfast, and continued on towards the Flathead Valley, with my
        stomach full of carbs. Climbing up into the valley felt good after the rest day. But the dust on this road was unbelievable! Every
        time a car or logging truck passed, I had to stop for a minute to let the dust settle before biking again
      </p>
      <img src="/images/GDMBR/section1/loggingtruck.png" alt="dusty!" width="50%" />
      <p>
        After the top of the pass into the valley, I saw no other people until the next day. It was a little eerie after how many people I
        was seeing over the past few days, but I was expecting this stretch to be the most remote of the whole trip. It was one of the most
        beautiful too. After reaching the bottom of the valley, I took a little siesta. This deer greeted me when I woke up, it didn't seem
        to be too bothered by humans which was surprising given how remote it felt here.

        Feeling refreshed from the nap, I carried on to try to make it up and back down the next pass. Along the way, I passed a few cabins
        that were open to bikers and hikers. I had my sights on a campsite on the other side of the upcoming pass so I pressed on.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/GDMBR/section1/butts.png" alt="hehe" width="50%" />
      <p>
        While climbing, I saw some tracks on the ground. I'm no expert but they were too small to be bear tracks and too big to be coyote or
        dog tracks. So I assumed there may have been a cougar nearby. I turned my speaker up to 11, and shouted every 5 minutes or so. The
        sun was setting quickly and I haven't seen another person in a while so that added to my paranoia, but after 30 minutes of fast
        climbing and no additional tracks, I calmed down a bit.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/GDMBR/section1/flathead.png" alt="sunset" width="80%" />
      <p>
        It was getting late and I wasn't going to make it to my originally planned campsite, so I stopped near the top of the pass instead.
        There was a cabin at the top but unfortunately, it is only open during the winter. I set up camp, had some dinner, and hung up my
        food from a bridge nearby.

      <h3>Day 7</h3>
      <p>
        With no coffee shops or stores to kill time at, I got right to biking early in the morning. Since I ended the previous day on top of
        a pass, the first 20 km were mostly downhill, and mostly easy. Unfortunately, my derailleur started giving me troubles early on in
        the day. The chain kept slipping off the pulleys every time I hit a bump too hard.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/GDMBR/section1/derailleur.png" alt="sunset" width="80%" />
      <p>
        But with my history of derailleur issues, I wasn't too surprised. I think the bike still has it's original derailleur, and I've had
        to bend the cage back into place a few times already, so things are probably not aligning as perfectly as they should. After
        rebuilding the derailleur and getting my hands all greasy, I continued the rest of the way down the pass. At the bottom, I finally
        saw some other humans! There were a few people fishing in the river.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/GDMBR/section1/flathead1.jpg" alt="sunset" width="80%" />
      <p>
        There was one last climb to get out of the Flathead valley, and it was quite eventful. The first stretch had plenty of ups and
        downs, climbing high up above the river just to descend back down. Even though there was lots of climbing, there was hardly any net
        elevation gain. I ran into a biker going the opposite direction who looked
        <i>speedy</i>
        . He didn't stop to chat but I wouldn't be surprised if he was doing a "yo-yo" of the Tour Divide, turning around and heading back
        North after reaching the Mexico border.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trail suddenly forked, with one road leading to a bridge and the other continuing along the river via a very overgrown trail. I
        was in denial at first, thinking that for a route this popular, there is no way that it follows a trail that overgrown. But boy was
        I wrong.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/GDMBR/section1/bushwacking.png" alt="sunset" width="80%" />
      <p>
        There were parts of the trail where I couldn't even see the ground through all the leaves. This area put me on edge since I had no
        way of knowing if there was any wildlife nearby. I just made lots of noise and turned my speaker on. This continued on for about a
        kilometer, before reaching a sudden incline.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/GDMBR/section1/thewall.png" alt="sunset" width="80%" />
      <p>
        I did no research on this section of the trail, so it took me completely by surprise. After checking my gps and confirming that I
        was in fact, on the right trail, I saw that this section was called "the wall". It seemed appropriate. I very slowly pushed my bike
        up, pulled the brakes, then used the traction of the wheels to pull myself up. There were some sections where this strategy didn't
        work, so I had to lift the bike and walk up while trying not to slip on the mud. Apparently, the correct way to do it is to take the
        bags off your bike and make two trips up the hill, but this idea did not cross my mind and I subjected myself to attempting to carry
        my heavy and awkwardly loaded bike with all the bags attached. After 15 minutes of huffing and puffing, I made it to an actual road
        with a reasonable grade. This was probably the slowest 100 meters of the entire trip.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the short and steep section done, all that was left was the remaining 90% of the climb. Parts of the road were still quite
        overgrown, but nothing as bad as
        <i>the wall</i>
        . About halfway through the climb, I passed a biker, but he was quite focused on the hill so I didn't stop to chat. About three
        minutes later, I passed two more, and three more minutes after that, I passed another! It was so good to see a group, and they were
        going the same way! I stopped to chat with the last biker for a minute but I was set on getting to the top of the climb so I pressed
        on. I met up with the last member of the group at the top of the pass, and we chatted while the rest of the group caught up. We made
        introductions and swapped stories about what we've seen on the trail so far. Two of the bikers, Kai and Clo, started in Alaska a
        couple months earlier and are planning on biking all the way down to the southern tip of Argentina! After some snacks, we were all
        chased away by the swarms of flies and continued down the pass. I didn't know it at the time but this was one of the biggest
        descents of the trip, going from around 1900m to 900m. After spending so much time in the alpine, the difference in temperature was
        shocking. There must have been at least a 15 degree difference between the top of the pass and the bottom of the next valley. The
        cool air and green shrubs were quickly replaced by warm gusts, dry ponderosa pines, and yellow grass as the elevation decreased.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/GDMBR/section1/greenergrass.JPG" alt="greenergrass" width="50%" />
      <p>
        The exit from the Flathead valley brought us 3 km from the US border. After being in the shade all day, the sun above and pavement
        below felt like being in an oven. Crossing the border was a breeze, I'm sure that the border agent has seen countless bikers go
        through already this summer. I stopped with one of the bikers from the group, Jon, at the bar at the border to get a drink before
        continuing on to Eureka. The city set up a campground in the town park to cater to all the bikers and hikers coming through on the
        divide.

      <h3>Day 8 (rest)</h3>
      <p>
        With the hot weather and sore legs from the Flathead valley, the group decided to spend a day relaxing in Eureka, so I decided to
        join them. After crossing the border, I realized just what I got myself into, and the last week was just the start! Continue reading
